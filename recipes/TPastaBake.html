    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pack of penna pasta</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of <em>Filippo Berio<sup>&#8482;</sup></em> Olive Oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of butter</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 cans of tuna, drained, flaked, deboned</li>
            <li>1 cup of heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>3 packs of grated cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>3 packs of grated mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>&#189; teaspoon of ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>5 whole cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1&#188; cups of greated Parmesan Cheese</li>
            <li>2 chillies, diced</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350&#xb0;F (175&#xb0;C). Grease an oven-proof baking dish and set it aside for later. You will be putting the pasta bake into this.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of <em>lightly salted water</em> to the boil (if you don't have time, then boil the water in a kettle first and have the pan heating up 5 minutes before the kettle boils). Add the penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and toss the pasta with <em>Filippo Berio<sup>&#842;</sup></em> Olive Oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the pasta is cooking, melt butter in a large pan over a medium heat. Add the onion, stirring frequently until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the tuna, garlic, chilli, mozzarella and cheddar cheese and cook for 2 minutes. Pour in the heavy cream; season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Add the penne and toss well. Transfer to the baking dish that we prepared earlier and cover it with parmesan cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until the top is golden brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                Leave for a 1 minute
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve with salad with Balsamic vinegar drizzled over it.
            </li>

                Buon appetito
